# Aurelia

Aurelia is a native music client for Jellyfin.

- Android is built with Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and Media3.
- iOS is built with SwiftUI and AVFoundation.
- The desktop prototype is built in Rust with mainline GPUI and Aurelia-owned controls.
- Shared Jellyfin, library, cache, and lyrics behavior lives in Rust. Mobile uses it through UniFFI; desktop links it directly.

## Quick start

Enter the Nix development shell when using NixOS:

```bash
nix develop
```

Build and test Android:

```bash
cd apps/mobile/android
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest assembleDebug
```

Build the Rust core and run its tests:

```bash
cargo test --workspace
```

Run the desktop prototype:

```bash
cargo run -p aurelia-desktop
```

The desktop app can authenticate with a Jellyfin server, persist the session,
sync a profile-specific library cache, and populate the home screen from that
cache. Playback controls remain a UI prototype and do not produce audio yet.

iOS builds require macOS with Xcode:

```bash
./apps/mobile/ios/build-rust.sh
open apps/mobile/ios/Aurelia.xcworkspace
```

See [docs/BUILDING.md](docs/BUILDING.md) and [docs/TESTING.md](docs/TESTING.md) for the complete workflows.
